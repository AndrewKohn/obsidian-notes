### Title: [[Page Structure]]
Date Created: ==2021-10-26, 16:30==

A group of links can be grouped for better page structure in a container called "nav"(igation).
```
<header>													//nav nested within header of the page.
<nav> 	
	<a href="link1.html">link1</a>
	<a href="link2.html">link2</a>
	<a href="link3.html">link3</a>
</nav>
</header>
```

"article" and "header" can specify what the content belongs to.  Perhaps a group of links on the top of the page belongs to the header.  A blogpost could be an article.
